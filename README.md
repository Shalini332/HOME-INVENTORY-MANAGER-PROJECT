# HOME-INVENTORY-MANAGER-PROJECT
In this project, we will build a home inventory manager program.  A toolbar control is used to add, delete and save items from the inventory. It is also used to navigate from one item to the next. The primary way to enter information about an inventory item is with several text field controls. A combo box is used to specify location, while a date chooser is used to select purchase date. A check box control indicates if an item is marked with identifying information. A button control (with an ellipsis) selects a photo to display in the panel control. A panel control holds 26 buttons for searching. The program has a built-in sample inventory file – the first item in that file is displayed (items are listed alphabetically by Inventory Item):A toolbar control is used to add, delete and save items from the inventory.
